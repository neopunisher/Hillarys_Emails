Thank you so much

Dear Bill and Tom,
I'm sorry that I cannot be on the Hill today as we had long planned, but very grateful that you both will be. The
Department and I appreciate your leadership everyday.
So, I'll be nursing my cracked head and cheering you on as you "remain calm and carry on"!
Happy Holidays--H
